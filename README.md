# squeeze_thing

Simple server for creating webthings from a squeezebox server.

Currently not much more than proof of concept quality.

It will reconnect if the squeeze server is restarted, but how well that works I've not tested well.

It currently expects the squeeze center to be on a host "squeeze", it should default to localhost
as that is a more sensible default.

All the things are labeled "Thing" and I've not worked out how to change that.
